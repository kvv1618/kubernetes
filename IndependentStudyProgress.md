## Hands-on progress till now:
- Setup KIND cluster for local Kubernetes development and testing.
- Forked Kubernetes repo and set up local development environment.
- Implemented basic Kdapt Scheduler plugin with scoring functionality. (returning static scores for testing)
- Genralised the plugin as per the Kubernetes scheduler plugin framework, and test it with static pod resource requests to verify that the plugin is being invoked correctly during scheduling.
- Written a simple bin pack scoring algo based on Node resource utilization, combining CPU and memory utilization, giving more weight to CPU.

### Testing methodology:
#### Static Pod testing:
- Deployed a static pod deployment using kdapt scheduler.
- The plugin at this point of time had a bias towards a specific node ("scheduler-lab-worker") by returning a score of 100 for that node and 60 for all other nodes.

    ```go
    func (k *Kdapt) Score(
        ctx context.Context,
        state fwk.CycleState,
        pod *v1.Pod,
        nodeInfo fwk.NodeInfo,
    ) (int64, *fwk.Status) {

        // A simple controlled static load test scoring function
        if nodeInfo.Node().Name == "scheduler-lab-worker" {
            return fwk.MaxNodeScore, fwk.NewStatus(fwk.Success)
        }
        return 60, fwk.NewStatus(fwk.Success)
    }
    ```
- Observed that all pods were scheduled on the "scheduler-lab-worker" node, confirming that the plugin was being invoked and influencing scheduling decisions as expected.

## Next Steps:
- Read Borg design paper to understand the inspiration behind Kubernetes scheduling.
- Re-create KIND cluster with uneven node resources to test the bin pack scoring algorithm on static pods with varying resource requests.
- Explore more complex scheduling scenarios with dynamic resource requests.
